### Introduction

##### Check if the Electron Application is packaged.

Checking the package status of an Electron Application can be tricky, this npm package solves this issue. Follow further instructions to implement the same inside your app.

Initially, I'd created **electron-is-packaged** package for [OpenMTP  - Advanced Android File Transfer Application for macOS](https://github.com/ganeshrvel/openmtp "OpenMTP  - Advanced Android File Transfer Application for macOS"). It works fine with [Electron React Redux Advanced Boilerplate](https://github.com/ganeshrvel/electron-react-redux-advanced-boilerplate "Electron React Redux advanced boilerplate") and [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate "electron-react-boilerplate")

## Installation

```shell
$ npm install electron-is-packaged

or 

$ yarn add electron-is-packaged
```

## Usage

```javascript
// Import ES6 way
import { isPackaged } from 'electron-is-packaged';

// Import ES5 way
const isPackaged = require('electron-is-packaged').isPackaged;

// Output: boolean
```
